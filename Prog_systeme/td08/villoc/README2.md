# Villoc

Villoc is a heap visualisation tool, it's a python script that renders a static
html file. An example can be seen here: http://wapiflapi.github.io/villoc/, this
is villoc running on an exploit of PlaidCTF 2015's challenge PlaidDB.

## How to

The easiest way to use villoc is probably to run the following command and open
out.html in a browser.

```shell
ltrace ./target |& villoc.py - out.html;
```

It is probably a good idea to disable ASLR for repeatable results and to use a
file to pass the ltrace to villoc because otherwise the target's error output
will be interleaved and might confuse villoc sometimes.

```shell
setarch x86_64 -R ltrace -o trace ./target; villoc.py trace out.html;
```

## Using DynamoRIO

The problem with ltrace is that it doesn't track calls to malloc from
other libraries or from within libc itself.

Please check https://github.com/wapiflapi/villoc/tree/master/tracers/dynamorio
for (easy!) instructions for using a DynamoRIO tool to achieve full tracing.


## Annotations

Villoc's input should look like ltrace's output, other tracers should output
compatible logs. Villoc also listens to annotations of the following form:

``` text
@villoc(comma separated annotations) = <void>`
```

When using this it's possible to mark certain block as being significant which
makes analyzing villoc's output that much easier.

### Annotations from C code through DynamoRIO.

When using the dynamorio tracer there is a hack to easily inject annotations
from a target's source code:

``` C
sscanf("Format string %d %d, FOO %s", "@villoc", 1, 2, "BAR");
```

Will inject `Format string 1 2` into villoc's log and add the `FOO`
and `BAR` tags to the block affected by the next memory operation.

## Which malloc

This has been made with glibc's dl_malloc in mind. But it should work for other
implementations, especially if you play with the `--header` and `--footer`
options to indicate how much overhead the targeted malloc adds to the user data.
